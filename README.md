Posição Data Engineer - Intellibrand/ Ascential - Exercício prático

This project consists basically of a Python script that gather data from the json files wich i have dowloaded and processed locally
and calculate the metrics of higher price variation and unavailibility

I was not able to import the JSON files to the repository due to performance issues with my limited computer resources
but it's just a matter of switching the path to the folder whereever the JSON files are and, then the script should do it's work
and print the results in the temrinal
